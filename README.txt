Thanks for taking the time to show us what you can do!

There are two tasks for you to complete:

 - cbc-react
   - Create a react app to search and return an image via the Giphy API
   - View the README.md in the folder for additional information
 - cbc-php
   - View the index.php file for instructions
 
Please document any dependencies or special build/run instructions when completing these tasks.

Open the files in an editor, read the instructions, and implement the solution 
to the task directly in the files.

You may use any resources at your disposal (books, online documentation,
StackOverflow, etc.), but you must do the work yourself.

When you are done, zip up all the files and send them to 
udorawala@wral.com.

Good luck!
